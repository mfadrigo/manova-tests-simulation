## Abstract
This study aims to investigate the impact of positive dependence in variance-covariance
matrices on the type I error rate and power of the four MANOVA tests: Pillai, Wilks,
Hotelling-Lawley, and Roy. With increasing strengths of dependence in the variance-covariance
matrix, we examined the trend of type I error rate and power across all tests. Type I error rate is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is true. Power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is false (correct conclusion). Then we assessed how these trends changed across increasing sample sizes. We considered a balanced design and
an unbalanced design with various scenarios. In the balanced design, when sample size
increased, type I error rate fluctuated and had no distinct pattern for any of the tests. The Roy test
consistently had the highest type I error rate, which fluctuated around 0.175. Similar patterns
were shown in the unbalanced design. In the balanced design, we saw a decrease in power as the
strength of dependence increased (across all tests), which suggested that the tests had a harder
time detecting group differences in the presence of strong variable dependence. However, as
sample size increased, this trend became less prominent. In the unbalanced design, all three tests
except Roy had nearly identical power trends as strength of dependence increased. Roy
consistently had the highest power in both designs.
